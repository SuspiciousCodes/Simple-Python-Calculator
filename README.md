## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   To get started, first clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuspiciousCodes/Simple-Python-Calculator.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

   Open the project folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd Simple-Python-Calculator
   
3. **Run the Calculator**

   Open the project folder:
   
   ```bash
   python Calculator.Program.py

## Usage

Once the script is running, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a mathematical operation. Follow the instructions by inputting your desired numbers and selecting the operation.

### Available Operations:
- **Addition**: `+`
- **Subtraction**: `-`
- **Multiplication**: `*`
- **Division**: `/`

## Example

  ```bash
  Enter an operator (+ - * /): +
